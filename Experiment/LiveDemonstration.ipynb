    "Sir Isaac Newton, a 17th-century English physicist and mathematician, introduced the three laws of motion in his work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687. These laws describe how objects behave when forces act upon them and form the foundation of classical mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s First Law, or the Law of Inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or continue moving in a straight line at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. This explains why passengers in a car lunge forward when the vehicle suddenly stops—their bodies continue moving due to inertia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s Second Law states that an object's acceleration is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This relationship is expressed as F = m × a. Because of this, pushing a full shopping cart is harder than pushing an empty one—the full cart has more mass and therefore requires more force to achieve the same acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Forces always occur in pairs. When someone walks, their foot pushes backward on the ground, and the ground pushes forward with equal force. Rockets work the same way: they push exhaust gases backward, and the reaction force pushes the rocket forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "These laws are essential in engineering, allowing designers to analyze force distribution, vehicle dynamics, and mechanical movement. They are also used in astronomy to understand planetary motion. While modern physics sometimes extends beyond Newton’s framework, his laws still accurately describe motion in most everyday situations."
